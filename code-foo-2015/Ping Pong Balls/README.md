How Many Ping-Pong balls can fit in a 747 airplane?
====================================================

When I saw this problem, my plan to an find answer consisted of finding a formula and finding the values of all of the variables in my formula.

Formula:
---------

The number of ping pong balls which can fit into the 747 is equal to:
volume of a 747 plane divided by volume of a ping pong ball.

Variables:
-----------

let V = volume of 747 plane <br />
let p = volume of a ping pong ball

Finding p:
-----------

Since there are varying ping pong ball sizes, I took an average of a couple different values I found:

(2.045 + 2 + 2.045)/3 =  2.03 cubic inches 
p = 2.03 cubic inches

Finding V:
-----------

To find V, I took an average of two differing value that I found:

value 1 = 1035 cubic meters <br />
value 2 = 37565 cubic feet

Before doing so, I converted value 2 to cubic meters: <br />
1 ft = .3048m  <===>  1 cubic foot = (.3048^3)m = .028317m (rounded) <br />
Therefore, 37565 cubic feet = 1063 meters

Now I average the two values:

(1035 + 1063)/2 = 1049m <br />
V = 1049m

Answer:
--------

Since p is in cubic inches, I must convert that to cubic meters as well:

1 inch cubed/61024 = 1m
So, 2.03 inches = 0.00003327m

Now I can plug into my formula:

V/p = 1049/0.00003327 = 31,529,907 ping pong balls can fit into a 747!
